 * config_parse: parse a simple key-value configuration file.
 * Arguments:

 *   config_map= map to fill with values (based on keys)
 *   fail      = whether to fail on errors in the config file
 * Returns:  0 = no problems detected
 *          -1 = file described by path could not be opened
 *           1 = (if fail != 0) on invalid line encountered
 *           2 = (if fail != 0) on invalid key encountered
 * Note: You must check tab yourself to see if any values have
 * changed. If you have values set to NULL, they may still be
 * NULL if the key was not found in the config file. All to say,
 * a config file that exists but is empty will cause 0 to be
 * returned.
