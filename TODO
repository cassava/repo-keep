TODO: REPO-UPDATE
=======================================================================

  1. Create a generic configuration file parser in the style that
     pacman uses for it's config file: /etc/pacman.conf
    
  2. Allow for multiple repositories (I'm going to make this depend
     on #1, for simplicity).
  
  3. Allow for automatic scanning of what has been updated to refresh the
     repository. (syntax: repo update)
  
  4. Allow for scanning the repository to see for which packages there are
     newer versions in the AUR. (This could be complicated, but would be
     very very useful.) (syntax: repo sync)
  
  5. Make sure that you don't delete just based on numbering, but also on age.
     (What is the current behaviour?)

  6. Rewrite the program, so that
         repo [arguments] cmd [arguments]
     So for example: repo sync
                     repo update
                     repo add google-earth
                     repo remove package
