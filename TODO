TODO: REPO-UPDATE
=======================================================================

  1. Create a generic configuration file parser in the style that
     pacman uses for it's config file: /etc/pacman.conf
    
  2. Allow for multiple repositories (I'm going to make this depend
     on #1, for simplicity).
  
  3. Allow for automatic scanning of what has been updated to refresh the
     repository.
  
  4. Allow for scanning the repository to see for which packages there are
     newer versions in the AUR. (This could be complicated, but would be
     very very useful.)
