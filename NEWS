===============================================================================

# 1.9.3 (26. May 2012)
This release provides primarily bugfixes, but the following list includes
changes from 1.9.1 and 1.9.2, because I was too lazy to update this when
I released those.

  - New available commands: update, list
  - The paths in the Zsh completion script are no longer absolute.
  - Moved the library functions outside repo, and use libcassava.a instead.

# 1.9.0beta (2. February 2012)
This release is the beginning of a complete rewrite of repo-update.  The naming
of the executable has been changed to just repo, the project has been renamed
repo-keep, the programming language has been changed to C, and many
improvements have been made to the concept (hence the name change).

  - Available commands: add, remove, (sync, update)
    Right now, sync and update do not work
  - See help for options


# 1.4.1 (20. April 2011)
This release just adds a Zsh completion script for repo-update,
and does not change the functionality of repo-update at all.

  - Added a Zsh completion script.
